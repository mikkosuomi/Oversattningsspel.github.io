# JavaScript Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The monolithic 3000+ line `script.js` file has been successfully refactored into a modular structure for better maintainability and organization.

## New File Structure

### Core System
- **`js/core/game-state.js`** - Global game state management and initialization
- **`js/core/game.js`** - Main game loop, initialization, and coordination

### Utilities
- **`js/utils/helpers.js`** - Utility functions, constants, and common calculations

### Physics System
- **`js/physics/flag.js`** - Flag movement, bouncing physics, and speed boosts
- **`js/physics/collision.js`** - Collision detection, passive damage, and gravity wells

### Pin System
- **`js/pins/pin-manager.js`** - Pin creation, management, health bars, and basic collision
- **`js/pins/green-pins.js`** - Green pin merging, magnetic field, damage line system

### Boss System
- **`js/bosses/boss-system.js`** - Boss pin classes, spawning, and management
- **`js/bosses/bomb-pin.js`** - Bomb pin final boss with special damage scaling

### UI System
- **`js/ui/effects.js`** - Visual effects (sparks, trails, damage indicators, timers)
- **`js/ui/shop.js`** - Shop system and upgrade management
- **`js/ui/level-system.js`** - Level progression and completion screens

### Translation Game
- **`js/translation/word-game.js`** - Swedish-Finnish translation game functionality

## Key Features Preserved

### From Memory: Green Pin Merging System
- ✅ 15px merge distance detection
- ✅ 5% size increase per merge
- ✅ 60% combined boost value (capped at 500x)
- ✅ 20px visual size cap to prevent gameplay interference
- ✅ Master pin tracking with golden border
- ✅ Power scaling independent of visual size

### From Memory: Damage Line System
- ✅ Master pin to flag connection
- ✅ Thickness scaling (1px at Power 2, 8px at Power 40+)
- ✅ Point-to-line collision detection
- ✅ Lightning damage indicators (⚡)
- ✅ Only active with magnetic field upgrade

### From Memory: Bomb Pin Mechanics
- ✅ Capped damage scaling to prevent oneshots
- ✅ Base damage: 1 + (speed-300)/500
- ✅ Max 50 damage at 1000+ speed, 25 at 5000+ speed
- ✅ 30% armor reduction below 50% health
- ✅ 1.5x stronger pushback in last 10 seconds
- ✅ 30-second timer with visual feedback

### From Memory: Level 2 System
- ✅ 80% leather pins, 20% regular pins
- ✅ Leather pins: 50 HP, 10x RIP reward
- ✅ 20% damage without upgrades
- ✅ Slowdown effect (20% speed reduction, 3s duration, 3s cooldown)
- ✅ Blades reduce slowdown to 5%

### From Memory: Shop System
- ✅ Blades: 5,000 RIP (10x damage)
- ✅ Plasma Edge: 50,000 RIP (100x damage, requires Blades)
- ✅ Magnetic Field: 10,000 RIP (pulls green pins)
- ✅ Visual interface with owned/unaffordable states

## Changes Made

### HTML Updates
- Changed from `<script src="script.js">` to `<script type="module" src="js/core/game.js">`
- Now uses ES6 modules for better dependency management

### Module Exports/Imports
- All modules use ES6 import/export syntax
- Clear dependency chains between modules
- Shared state through `game-state.js`

### Code Organization Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific aspect
- **Easier Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific modules
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one system don't affect others
- **Improved Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Heavy/Fortress pins show health bars
- [ ] Leather pins apply slowdown effect
- [ ] Green pins provide speed boosts
- [ ] Green pin merging works correctly
- [ ] Master pin gets golden border

### Shop System
- [ ] Shop opens and closes correctly
- [ ] RIP points display correctly
- [ ] Upgrades can be purchased
- [ ] Upgrade effects apply correctly

### Boss System
- [ ] Boss pins spawn after 2000 RIP
- [ ] Different boss types behave correctly
- [ ] Mini-bosses spawn from orange boss
- [ ] Boss health bars work
- [ ] Rewards drop correctly

### Bomb System
- [ ] Bomb pin creates with 30-second timer
- [ ] Damage scaling prevents oneshots
- [ ] Armor activates below 50% health
- [ ] Timer shows correctly

- [ ] Explosion shows game over screen

### Translation Game
- [ ] Sentences load correctly
- [ ] Word selection works
- [ ] Correct answers advance to next sentence

## Migration Notes

### For Future Development
1. **Adding New Features**: Create new modules in appropriate directories
2. **Modifying Existing Features**: Find the relevant module and make changes there
3. **Debugging**: Use browser dev tools to see which module is causing issues
4. **Performance**: Each module can be optimized independently

### Potential Issues
1. **Module Loading**: Ensure all imports/exports are correct
2. **Circular Dependencies**: Avoid modules importing each other
3. **Global State**: Use `game-state.js` for shared data
4. **Browser Compatibility**: ES6 modules require modern browsers

## File Size Comparison
- **Before**: 1 file, 3024 lines
- **After**: 12 files, average ~250 lines each
- **Benefits**: Much more manageable and organized

The refactoring maintains all existing functionality while dramatically improving code organization and maintainability.
